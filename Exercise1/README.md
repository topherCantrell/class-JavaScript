# Exercise 1: Application Project

## From: Lesson Summary Section 2

These projects will challenge you to use what you have learned in this lesson.

Create an XHTML page with a JavaScript block in the `<head>` section of the document
and another JavaScript block in the `<body>` section. In the first JavaScript block, create
four variables named `string1`, `string2`, `string3` and `string4`. Assign the value start
to `string1`. Assign the return value of a `prompt()` method as the value for `string2`. Assign
the return value of a `confirm()` method as the value for `string3`. Assign the value end
to `string4`.

In the second JavaScript block, create a `document.write()` statement that outputs the
text Hello, World. Make this text Heading Level 3 (`<h3>`). Create a
second `document.write()` that outputs the values of each of the four variables created in
the first JavaScript block. Experiment with different methods of ensuring that a space
exists between each value. After the code is working properly, determine a way to
output the four variable values on separate lines of the XHTML page.

As you experiment with the page, observe the values that are returned in various
situations. For instance, note the value that is returned if the user selects the Cancel
button on a prompt dialog box.

Create a second XHTML page with a JavaScript block in the `<head>` section of the
document and another JavaScript block in the `<body>` section. In the first JavaScript
block, create two variables named `number1` and `number2`. Assign different numerical values
to each variable. In the second JavaScript block, experiment with the various arithmetic
and comparison operators shown in Table 2-4. Create a `document.write()` statement that
outputs the results of the operations.
