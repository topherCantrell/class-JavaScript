# Exercise 4: Application Project

## From: Lesson Summary 9

## Application Project


This project will challenge you to use some of what you have learned in this lesson.

Choose a real-life object with which you are familiar, such as a bicycle or a car. Write
down the properties that apply to this object. Create an XHTML page that will display
the properties of this object. In the context of this lesson, you will want to create a
custom JavaScript object to represent the item. Use the steps outlined in this lesson to
create and instantiate your custom object.

You will need to devise a way to display the information for your custom object. This
task can be accomplished in many ways. Use concepts and skills that you have learned
throughout this course. You may want to display information in alert dialog boxes, or
you may want to create new windows to display the data. Experiment with various ways
of displaying information for your custom object.

As you work on your project, experiment with creating individual custom objects and
creating arrays of custom objects. With arrays of custom objects, experiment with the
methods that are available for array manipulation. For instance, can you think of a use
for the `Array` object's `sort()` method applied to an array of custom objects?
